# plygon-fractal

If you draw a triangle on a piece of paper, then select a random point anywhere on the paper and repeat a process n number of times, the resulting cluster of points will resemble a fractal. The process consists of selecting a random vertex of the polygon and drawing a point in the middle, between the first point and the random vertex, this new point will be used for the next iteration.

This file contains a demo of the process, global variables can be changed to use different polygons, as well as the number of times the loop will be repeated.
